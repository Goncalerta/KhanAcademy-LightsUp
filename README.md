# Lights Up!

- See if you can make every tile in the board on! Or off... There is really no win screen, so you do what you want...
- You can change the URL to tweak some parameters. For example, adding `?debug=true&x=6&y=7` at the end of the URL will generate a 6x7 board and activate debug mode!

This is a project originally made by me (Goncalerta) in [KhanAcademy](http://khanacademy.org/) back in 2015.
Almost no changes where made, only those really needed to make it able to run outside the website.
